/**
 * @fileoverview Emit the bundle's own npm-dependency declaration.
 *
 * **The gap this closes.** The synced bundle imports ~16 npm packages and
 * declared none of them anywhere a consumer could read. The derived set already
 * existed — `bundleDeps()` / `requiredDeps()` in `lib/install/deps.mjs` — but it
 * is source-repo-only by construction: it walks `getAllConsumerInventories()`,
 * which needs the consumer registry that never syncs. So in a consumer the set
 * was unrepresentable, not merely unlisted, and three things went wrong at once
 * (reported 2026-09-07, upstream ea23dfda):
 *
 *   1. `check-setup.mjs` special-cased exactly ONE dependency (playwright) and
 *      exited 0 on an install missing `ts-morph` — the same "structurally unable
 *      to report the dependency four skills cannot run without" argument its own
 *      comment makes, applied to the other fifteen.
 *   2. A consumer's `knip` reported four of them as unused on a clean main and
 *      blocked every push: the tooling tree is gitignored, so knip only sees the
 *      importers when the tree is hydrated. Its "Remove from ignoreDependencies"
 *      hint has the same blindness, so it argued for uninstalling packages four
 *      skills require — which is what happened there on 2026-07-28.
 *   3. `addDevDepsArgs`/`displayAddDev` show these are meant as
 *      **devDependencies**, and nothing transmitted that intent. The reporting
 *      consumer had four of them in `dependencies`, shipping to a production
 *      image built with `npm ci --omit=dev`.
 *
 * **Category B generated artifact**: a pure, deterministic function of committed
 * source — no clock, no sha, no network — committed and freshness-verified in
 * the pre-push `check` via `--check`. Two regenerations of one commit are
 * byte-identical, which is the test AGENTS.md sets for a tracked generated file.
 *
 * It lands at `scripts/lib/bundle-deps.json` and is listed in CORE_ASSETS, so it
 * syncs like any other asset and is hashed into `scripts/.sync-manifest.json` —
 * which is what keeps gate 2C from reading it as an orphan.
 *
 * **The READ half is `lib/install/bundle-deps.mjs`, not here.** This CLI cannot
 * sync (it walks the consumer registry), and the reader has to run where the
 * bundle lands.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/generate-bundle-deps.mjs            # write
 *   node scripts/generate-bundle-deps.mjs --check    # exit 1 on drift
 *   node scripts/generate-bundle-deps.mjs --json     # machine-readable result
 *
 * Exit codes: 0 fresh/written · 1 drifted (with --check) · 2 usage error
 *
 * @module scripts/generate-bundle-deps
