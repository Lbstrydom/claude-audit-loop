/**
 * @fileoverview Refuse a sync that would move a consumer BACKWARDS.
 *
 * ## The incident (2026-09-07)
 *
 * A fix delivered to all three consumers at 08:45 was overwritten at 10:48 by a
 * session pushing from a tree that predated it; all three went silently back to
 * the broken code. That push never landed — `origin/main` did not move — but the
 * damage did, and nothing anywhere reported it.
 *
 * Two properties combine. The sync runs from `.githooks/pre-push` against
 * `$REPO_ROOT`, the PUSHING WORKTREE's own tree; and git fires a pre-push hook
 * BEFORE the remote accepts anything. So a push that is rejected, abandoned, or
 * merely made from a stale worktree rewrites every consumer from whatever tree
 * that session happens to hold. One operator running several agent sessions
 * against one checkout is the ordinary case here, not an edge case — the same
 * premise `sync-receipt.mjs`'s own v2 header already had to correct.
 *
 * It was undetectable after the fact by construction: a receipt records what a
 * sync DID, never whether it should have, so each consumer logged the rollback
 * as an ordinary successful sync.
 *
 * ## Why this lives here and not in sync-to-repos.mjs
 *
 * The oracle and the refusal wording are cohesive, and `sync-to-repos.mjs` is
 * already over the file-size ratchet's limit — a file that size may not grow
 * (AGENTS.md). Extracting keeps the CLI's share to the call and the decision
 * directly testable without a subprocess.
 *
 * The pure predicate itself is `detectSourceRollback` in `sync-receipt.mjs`: it
 * is a question about the receipt's own contents, and it belongs beside the
 * other readers of that shape.
 *

/**
 * Build an `(ancestor, descendant) => 'yes'|'no'|'unknown'` oracle over one
 * checkout.
 *
 * The three-valued answer is the whole point, and it is the trap
 * `lib/worktree-identity.mjs` documents: `git merge-base --is-ancestor` reports
 * a NEGATIVE answer with exit 1, and an execution failure ALSO exits non-zero.
 * Only a clean exit-1 with empty stderr is an answer; everything else is
 * `unknown`, which `detectSourceRollback` treats as "not a rollback" so a git
 * problem can never block a legitimate delivery.
 *
 * A sha the consumer recorded on another machine simply is not in this
 * checkout — `rev-parse` fails, and `unknown` is the honest reply rather than a
 * fabricated `no`.
 *
 * No `env:` override: `scrubAmbientGitEnv()` has already deleted
 * GIT_DIR/GIT_WORK_TREE from this process by the time any caller reaches here,
 * so inheriting `process.env` resolves from `cwd` as intended.
 *
 * @param {string} sourceRoot
 * @returns {(ancestor: string, descendant: string) => 'yes'|'no'|'unknown'}
