/**
 * Record a regression spec authored by /ux-lock. Every row upserts by
 * (repo_id, spec_path); `unit-test` additionally discriminates on
 * source_finding_id.
 *
 * The 'persona-consistency-candidate' kind was RETIRED 2026-08-11 along with
 * the promotion path — a candidate row was an un-materialised spec, and
 * nothing consumes them now. `persona-consistency-locked` rows (already
 * promoted, spec on disk) are untouched and still redact their JSONB columns.
 *
 * Pre-egress redaction applies to the three JSONB columns (witness_snapshot,
 * contradiction_payload, journey_context) on locked rows (Gemini-R6-G3).
 *
 * **Returns a discriminated result** (plan §2b F2, 2026-08-12). It returned a
 * bare `null` for EIGHT distinct causes — cloud-off, five separate input
 * refusals, an upsert that returned no row, and a caught DB failure — and its
 * CLI caller wrote `ok: !!specId`, so a store outage and a missing description
 * were the same envelope. Cloud-off is `{ok:false, cloud:false, reason:'cloud-off'}`
 * so a caller can report a supported mode as such rather than as a failure.
 *
 * @returns {Promise<{ok:true, cloud:boolean, specId:string}

  //
  // WHY unit-test carries `source_finding_id` in its key (migration
  // 20260801120000). Under /ux-lock, one spec file pins one fix, so
  // (repo, path) IS the row identity. A unit/integration test routinely covers
  // several findings, so keying on the path alone made each new lock REASSIGN
  // the previous one — the finding silently returned to `unlocked_fixes` while
  // the call still reported `locked:true`. The identity of a unit-test lock is
  // which FINDING the file pins, not the file.
  //
  // Every arbiter is now a PARTIAL unique index, so each needs a `WHERE`
  // matching the index predicate or Postgres cannot infer it (42P10 on every
  // write). Predicates are byte-aligned with the migrations:
  //   unit-test → idx_regression_specs_unit_test_lock        (20260801120000)
  //   other     → idx_regression_specs_path_nonunit          (20260801120000)
  // A total index trivially satisfies any predicate, so these also work
  // against the pre-20260801120000 schema — the migration may lag the code.
  // The candidate arbiter is gone with the promotion path; its index and column

/**
 * Every recorded lock's cited `spec_path` for a repo — the raw material for the

 * resolves them through `classifyTestPath` — the same oracle `lock-with-test` already
 * refuses on, rather than a second spelling of "does this path exist".
 *
 * **Why a READ-side check is the primary instrument** (upstream report `b2c9a63f`, and
 * the upstream evidence contradicts the report's first option). A citation's truth is not
 * a property of the moment it was written. Measured here 2026-09-06: 3 of 235 rows cite a
 * path that no longer resolves, all three `source_kind: 'unit-test'` — i.e. written BY
 * `lock-with-test`, which DOES validate existence — and all three deleted by one commit,
 * `e833b2aa` ("retire the consistency candidate promotion path"). They were true when
 * recorded and were invalidated afterwards by a legitimate refactor, so a write-time check
 * would have caught **zero** of them. The reporter's three were the opposite case (tests
 * on unmerged branches, true-soon). Only a read-time check catches both.
 *
 * It matters because a lock REMOVES a finding from `unlocked_fixes` — that view's only
 * lock predicate is `EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM regression_specs …)`. A dangling citation
 * therefore reads as coverage forever, and the view whose entire job is surfacing
 * unlocked fixes will never mention it again. An obligation discharged by silence, which
 * is the exact failure `agedOut` was added for one axis over.
 *
 * Cloud-off and query failure both return `[]` — this feeds a non-blocking nudge and must
 * never break a push. The CALLER distinguishes "no dangling locks" from "not measured";
 * an empty array here is not a clean bill of health on its own.
